Dear Code Reviewer, 

The file in Input folder has desired attributes, the file in output folder has required output details and LTV. Srs folder has the core java code. The solution is not complete as per the requirements (because the average a for the week is not calculated but pre-calculated and hard coded) but best this is my effort. I am still learning Python so could not use that but did basic coding in Java during college, so used java.
 
Thanks!
